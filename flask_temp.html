<title>GeekTechStuff Room Temperature</title>

<h1>Welcome to the GeekTechStuff Room Temperature Page!</h1>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Temperature</h2>
<p>The room is currently {{temp}} degress centigrade. If it gets close to 0 degrees centigrade then water will freeze, at 100 degrees centigrade water will boil. Either of these temperatures is too extreme for Gary.</p>

<h2>Pressure</h2>
<p>The room pressure is currently {{pressure}} hectopascals. A hectopascal (hPa) is equal to 100 pascals or 1 millibar.</p>

<h3>CPU Temperature</h3>
<p>Just as humans have a core temperature so does the little Raspberry Pi 3 running this project. Currently it is running at {{cpu_temp}} degrees centigrade.</p>

<h3>Date/Time</h3>
<p>It is currently {{now}}, if this date or time is more than a few seconds out of date then please give the page a refresh.</p>
